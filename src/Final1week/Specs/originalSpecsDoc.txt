17. Support three additives, the order specifies the volume in cc: (domains: order[<additive> <vol>])
	17.1 UVInhibiter
	17.2 AntiBacterial
	17.3 Hydrophilic

19. Simulate mixing plastic, color, and additives with volume recipe & total (account for multiple cavities):
	19.1 cout << "    Load plastic bin with <plastic> and color bin with <color>.\n";
	19.2 cout << "      Recipe: <plastic>(<vol>) <color>(<vol>) <additive1>(<vol>)... = <shape vol> cc.\n";
		 19.2.1 Volume of base plastic = shape volume - color volume - sum of additive volumes.
	19.3 cout << "      Volume: <shape>(<shape vol>) * <cavities> cavitie(s) = <total vol> cc.\n";


25. Instrument the destructors:
	25.1 cout << "~<ClassName> ";
	25.2 Or better, use the DTOR macro in macros.h
		 25.2.1 Then if your class hiearachy differs too much you can easily turn dtor instrumentation off
	25.3 Use newlines to logically group the class heirarchies

26. To get the diffs to zero (just a suggestion):
	26.1 #include finalDesign.h
	26.2 In your main(int argc, char* args[]):
		26.2.1 final_design::demo(string(args[1]));	// Pass in the input file (orders_1.txt).
		26.2.2 <program>.exe orders_1.txt > design1.out
		26.2.3 diff design1.out design1Base.out (Should be no difference.)
	26.3 For Part I (2 weeks) you might copy finalDesign.h to finalOriginal.h
		26.3.1 Include it and modify main to call it
		26.3.2 <program>.exe orders_1.txt > original1.out
		26.3.3 diff original1.out original1Base.out (Add code until diffs are zero.)
	26.4 For Part II (in class) you might copy your finalOriginal.h to finalSolution.h
		26.4.1 <program>.exe orders_2.txt > original2.out
		26.4.2 diff original2.out original2Base.out (Diffs should be zero.)
		26.4.3 Include it and modify main to call it
		26.4.2 <program>.exe orders_1.txt > solution1.out
		26.4.3 diff solution1.out solution1Base.out (Diffs should be zero.)
		26.4.2 <program>.exe orders_2.txt > solution2.out
		26.4.4 diff solution2.out solution2Base.out (Add code until diffs are zero.)
	26.5 Email your finalOriginal.h to me at start of class
	26.6 Email your finalSolution.h to me when you are done
