		 10.3.2 rejectRate_pcnt = if(PET) then legacy_classes::rejectRateHigh_pcnt else legacy_classes::rejectRateLow_pcnt
		 10.3.3 runTime = legacy_classes::setupAvg_min
						+ (1 + 0.01*rejectRate_pcnt)*orderSize/cavities*cycletime
			 			+ legacy_classes::teardownAvg_min;
11. Add Styrene as a new synthetic plastic:

		16.3.4 cout << "      using EDM tools (static punch, static slice, and static etch) to mill <metal> block into <n> <shape> shape(s) with <finish> finish.\n";
17. Add Stuffing machine for bubble wrap:
	17.1 Bubblewrap ("bubble wrap").
	17.2 Triggered when parts bin is full.
	17.3 cout << "        Bubblewrap stuffer triggered to fill <output> parts bin.\n";

18. Resize too large orders to largest available:
	18.1 400,000 reduced to 200,000.
